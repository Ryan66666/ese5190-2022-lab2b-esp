## Modified Code Parts:

- change to the I2C pins (22)

```
const uint CAPTURE_PIN_BASE = 22;
const uint CAPTURE_PIN_COUNT = 2;
const uint CAPTURE_N_SAMPLES = 96;
const uint BOOT_PIN = 21;

```

- Disabled trigger

```
//pio_sm_exec(pio, sm, pio_encode_wait_gpio(trigger_level, trigger_pin));
logic_analyser_arm(pio, sm, dma_chan, capture_buf, buf_size_words, CAPTURE_PIN_BASE, false);
```

- Add loop
```
    PIO pio = pio0;
    uint sm = 0;
    uint dma_chan = 0;
    printf("Press BOOT PIN to Start Measure");
    logic_analyser_init(pio, sm, CAPTURE_PIN_BASE, CAPTURE_PIN_COUNT, 256.f);
while(1){
    if (gpio_get(BOOT_PIN) == 0){
    logic_analyser_arm(pio, sm, dma_chan, capture_buf, buf_size_words, CAPTURE_PIN_BASE, false);
    print_capture_buf(capture_buf, CAPTURE_PIN_BASE, CAPTURE_PIN_COUNT, CAPTURE_N_SAMPLES);
        }
    }
}
```

This section, we hae to modify the example code to monitor the I2C traffic, for doing that we can use the PIO function with pio0 and sm0. Each state machine, along with its supporting hardware, occupies approximately the same silicon area as a standard serial interface block, such as an SPI or I2C controller. However, PIO state machines can be configured and reconfigured dynamically to implement numerous different interfaces. Making state machines programmable in a software-like manner, rather than a fully configurable logic fabric like a CPLD, allows more hardware interfaces to be offered in the same cost and power envelope. This also presents a more familiar programming model, and simpler tool flow, to those who wish to exploit PIOâ€™s full flexibility by programming it directly, rather than using a premade interface from the PIO library.
